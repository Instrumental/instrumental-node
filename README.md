# Instrumental Node.js  Agent

Instrumental is a [application monitoring platform](https://instrumentalapp.com) built for developers who want a better understanding of their production software. Powerful tools, like the [Instrumental Query Language](https://instrumentalapp.com/docs/query-language), combined with an exploration-focused interface allow you to get real answers to complex questions, in real-time.

This agent supports custom metric monitoring for Node.js applications. It provides high-data reliability at high scale, without ever blocking your process or causing an exception. 

## Installation

````shell
npm install instrumental-node
````

Package details on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/instrumental-node)

## Usage

You will need to set the API token. API tokens can be found in the [project tokens documentation](https://instrumentalapp.com/docs/tokens) or in your user settings page. Use the 'enabled' flag to control if the agent actually reports. This is useful for not reporting in dev/test/staging/etc. environments.

````javascript
var I = require('instrumental-node');
I.configure({
  // from here: https://instrumentalapp.com/docs/tokens
  apiKey:  'project_api_token',

  // optional, default shown
  host:    'collector.instrumentalapp.com',

  // optional, default shown
  enabled: true,
});

// increments
I.increment('metric.name' /*, value = 1, time = now, count = 1 */);

// gauges
I.gauge('metric.name', 82.12 /*, time = now, count = 1 */);

// notices
I.notice('An event occurred' /*, time = now, duration = 0 */);
````
